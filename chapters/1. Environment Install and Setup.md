      ---
      ***NOTE:** Consult your leadership and refer to IBM's internal processes and procedures applicable to your team to ensure other VSCode settings not covered by this course are in full compliance with IBM's standards.*

      ---

  - ## 1.2 Install Virtualbox
    - Website: https://www.virtualbox.org/
    - Recommended version is `6.1.10`. If you have an older version installed, consider upgrading it.
    ---
    ***IMPORTANT:** For Windows, ensure Virtualbox is installed in a path without special characters (e.g. use `C:\virtualbox`).*

    ---
  - ## 1.3 Install Vagrant
    - Website: https://www.vagrantup.com/
    - Recommended install version is `2.2.9`.
    - After the install is complete, run `vagrant --version` to confirm Vagrant was installed correctly:
      ```shell
      $ vagrant --version
      Vagrant 2.2.9
      $
      ```
    - ### 1.3.1 Vagrant Virtualbox Guest Additions Plugin Setup
      - After Vagrant is installed, run `vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest` in a Shell/Powershell prompt:
        ```shell
        $ vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest
        Installing the 'vagrant-vbguest' plugin. This can take a few minutes...
        Installed the plugin 'vagrant-vbguest (0.24.0)'!
        $
        ```
    ---
    ***NOTE:** On Windows, it may be necessary to reboot the system at this point.*

    ---

  - ## 1.4 Install Git
    - Website: https://git-scm.com/
    - Recommended install version is `2.27.0`.
    - After the install is complete, run `git --version` to confirm Git was properly installed:
      ```shell
      $ git --version
      git version 2.27.0
      $
      ```
  - ## 1.5 Install GitHub Desktop

    ---
    ***NOTE:** GitHub Desktop is currently available fo Mac and Windows only. Linux users, please refer to step **[1.6.1 Cloning the Repository from GitHub](<1. Environment Install and Setup.md#161-cloning-the-repository-from-github>)** for an alternate method to download the course material.*

    ---

    - Website: https://desktop.github.com/
    - Recommended install version is `2.5.2`.
    - ### 1.5.1 Connect to GitHub Enterprise Using Your w3ID
      - After the install is complete, go to `GitHub Desktop > Preferences` (Mac) or `File > Options` (Windows), then go to the `Accounts` tab and click `Sign In` next to **GitHub Enterprise Server**;
      - In the **Sign In** dialog box, type `github.ibm.com` in the **Enterprise Server address** field and click `Continue`. You will then be prompted to click `Continue With Browser`;
      - Insert your w3ID as needed and accept any requests asking to open links in GitHub Desktop.

  - ## 1.6 Lab Environment Setup
    Our lab environment consists of four VMs that are automatically configured and provisioned using Vagrant:

    - `controlserver`: A CentOS 7 host with Ansible 2.7.11 already installed and configured. This will be the host from which we'll run all Ansible-related commands.

    - `linuxserver01` and `linuxserver02`: These are hosts running CentOS 6 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 (respectively) and will be accessed by Ansible.

    - `windowsserver01`: This is a Windows Server Standard 2016 (Evaluation), and will be the target of Ansible's Windows-related tasks.

    Throughout the course, we will only need log into `controlserver`.
    - ### 1.6.1 Cloning the Repository from GitHub

      - In this repository's Main page (https://github.ibm.com/la-innovation/ansible_essentials), click the green dropdown `Clone or download` button in the upper-right corner and choose `Open in Desktop` (Mac / Windows) or `Download ZIP` (Linux);

      - **Mac / Windows:**
        - If you installed GitHub Desktop correctly and clicked `Open in Desktop`, you should've been automatically redirected to it and be able to see the **Clone a Repository** form pre-populated with the repository URL and a suggested local path. Update the local path as needed and click `Clone`.

        - Once you have a local clone of the repository, click `Branch > New Branch` in GitHub Desktop, then type `user/<yourusername>` (e.g. `users/hfneto`) in the **Name** field and click the **Create Branch** button. This ensures that you can safely modify and submit your playbook updates back to this GitHub repository without affecting the original content.


      - **Linux:**
        - If you selected `Download ZIP`, you just need to save and unzip the file in the path of your choice.

        ---
        ***NOTE:** When using the `Download ZIP` method, while you can use the course material just fine, you will not be able to automatically receive updates from the course's `ansible_essentials` repository without manually configuring you terminal to connect to IBM's GitHub using an SSH key. This synchronization procedure is not currently covered in this course.*

        ---

    - ### 1.6.2 Running/Resetting the Lab Environment

      - To automatically provision all servers for our lab, run `servers/servers_init.sh` (Mac/Linux Shell) or `servers/servers_init.ps1` (Windows Powershell).

      - To automatically stop all running servers without deleting them, run `servers\servers_stop.sh` (Mac/Linux Shell) or `servers\servers_stop.ps1` (Windows Powershell).

      - To reset the lab and stop/remove all VMs from your system, run `servers/servers_reset.sh` (Mac/Linux Shell) or `servers\servers_reset.ps1` (Windows Powershell).

        ---
        ***NOTE:** Both the `servers_init` and `servers_reset` commands may take several minutes to complete!*

        *It is also recommended that you temporarily disable VPN access when running the `servers_init` scripts for the first time (or when rebuilding the environment after running `servers_reset`) as the VPN DNS settings can impact the search for software packages when provisioning some of the VMs.*

        ---

      - To provision and/or start a specific VM, go to its respective directory and run the commands below:

        Mac/Linux:
        ```shell
        $ cd ~/ansible_essentials/servers/controlserver
        $ vagrant up

        $ cd ~/ansible_essentials/servers/linuxserver01
        $ vagrant up

        $ cd ~/ansible_essentials/servers/linuxserver02
        $ vagrant up

        $ cd ~/ansible_essentials/servers/windowsserver01
        $ vagrant up

        ```

      - To stop a specific VM, go to its respective directory and run the commands below:
        ```shell
        $ cd ~/ansible_essentials/servers/controlserver
        $ vagrant halt

        $ cd ~/ansible_essentials/servers/linuxserver01
        $ vagrant halt

        $ cd ~/ansible_essentials/servers/linuxserver02
        $ vagrant halt

        $ cd ~/ansible_essentials/servers/windowsserver01
        $ vagrant halt
        ```
      - To permanently delete a VM, go to its respective directory and run the commands below:
        ```shell
        $ cd ~/ansible_essentials/servers/controlserver
        $ vagrant destroy -f

        $ cd ~/ansible_essentials/servers/linuxserver01
        $ vagrant destroy -f

        $ cd ~/ansible_essentials/servers/linuxserver02
        $ vagrant destroy -f

        $ cd ~/ansible_essentials/servers/windowsserver01
        $ vagrant destroy -f
        ```

        ---
        ***NOTE:** Your path leading to the `ansible_essentials/servers` directory may be different based on your operating system and where you downloaded the GitHub repository.*

        ---

    - ### 1.6.3 Validating your Lab Environment
      - Connect to `controlserver` using `vagrant ssh`:
        ```shell
        $ cd ~/ansible_essentials/servers/controlserver
        $ vagrant ssh
        ```
      - Once connected to `controlserver`, run the following `ansible` commands to validate connectivity to the other servers:
        ```shell
        $ ansible -i ~/ansible/custom_inventory.json -m ping linux

        $ ansible -i ~/ansible/custom_inventory.json -m win_ping windows
        ```
      - If everything works as expected, you should get an output like the one below, which means we are ready to move on to the next chapter:
        ```shell
        [vagrant@localhost ~]$ ansible -i ~/ansible/custom_inventory.json -m ping linux
        linuxserver01 | SUCCESS => {
            "changed": false,
            "ping": "pong"
        }
        linuxserver02 | SUCCESS => {
            "changed": false,
            "ping": "pong"
        }
        [vagrant@localhost ~]$ ansible -i ~/ansible/custom_inventory.json -m win_ping windows
        windowsserver01 | SUCCESS => {
            "changed": false,
            "ping": "pong"
        }
        [vagrant@localhost ~]$
        ```

    ---
    ***NOTE:** From this point, all terminal commands in this course will be run from within `controlserver` and assume you have already connected to it using `vagrant ssh`, unless specifically stated otherwise.*
