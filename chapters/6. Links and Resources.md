  - ## BlueOps LA Innovation Portal (https://blueops.br.ibm.com/):
    This is where you can learn more about the LA Innovation team's initiatives, automation catalog, our **[Next](https://blueops.br.ibm.com/automation-events-and-incidents/)** platform (powered by Ansible) and the Community Model which allows you to leverage our IBM Cloud-based infrastructure to run your playbooks and solutions to solve our client's most pressing issues.

  - ## Ansible Documentation (https://docs.ansible.com/):
    This is Ansible's official Help and Documentation repository. It is full of tutorials, how-to guides, community information and, most importantly, **[comprehensive information about all modules](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/modules_by_category.html)**.

  - ## Ansible Galaxy (https://galaxy.ansible.com/):
    Here you can find thousands of freely available, community-developed roles that you can easily use to jumpstart your solution's development process. You can also contribute back to the external community - just be mindful of IBM's [Business Conduct Guidelines](https://w3.ibm.com/tools/bcg/protect/BcgMain.wss) when doing so.

  - ## LA Innovation's GitHub Repository (https://github.ibm.com/la-innovation):
    When you're ready to contribute your solutions to the IBM Community, this is where they'll be stored! Feel free to explore our other open solutions, and then head over to our **[Next Scripts](https://github.ibm.com/la-innovation/next_scripts)** repository in order to see the Ansible playbooks we have in place, and how your solutions can fit in!
